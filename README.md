<code>Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass</code> <br />
- This command is used to change the PowerShell execution policy for the current PowerShell session only (Scope: Process).
- The -ExecutionPolicy Bypass flag bypasses the PowerShell script execution policy. It allows the execution of scripts without any restrictions in the current session.
- This command is sometimes used to bypass execution policies that restrict script execution for security purposes. However, it's important to use this with caution as it might pose security risks by allowing the execution of potentially harmful scripts.

<code>.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1</code>  <br />
- This command is specific to Python virtual environments created using tools like virtualenv or venv.
- Activate.ps1 is a script used to activate a Python virtual environment. When you create a virtual environment in Python, it isolates dependencies and packages for a specific project.
- Activating the virtual environment sets up the environment-specific variables and paths, allowing you to work with the specific Python interpreter and libraries installed within that environment.
